RubyScript2Exe transforms your Ruby script into a standalone,
compressed Windows, Linux or Mac OS X (Darwin) executable. You
can look at it as a "compiler". Not in the sense of a
source-code-to-byte-code compiler, but as a "collector", for it
collects all necessary files to run your script on an other
machine: the Ruby script, the Ruby interpreter and the Ruby
runtime library (stripped down for this script). Anyway, the
result is the same: a standalone executable (application.exe).
And that's what we want!

The best way to use Tar2RubyScript is the RB, not this TAR.GZ.
The latter is just for playing with the internals. Both are
available on the site.
